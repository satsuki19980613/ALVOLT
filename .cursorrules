# 🛠️ ALVOLT Workflow Modes

## 1. INVESTIGATE MODE (Start with "INVESTIGATE:")
When I ask you to "INVESTIGATE: [Issue]", do NOT write code.
1. Search the codebase (@Codebase) to identify all relevant files and logic.
2. Output a summary in the following format for me to send to Gemini:
   - **Target Issue:** [Summary of the issue]
   - **Relevant Files:** [List of file paths]
   - **Current Logic Analysis:** [Brief explanation of how it works now]
   - **Request to Architect:** "Please provide a solution and implementation code based on the ALVOLT project rules."

## 2. AUDIT MODE (Start with "AUDIT:")
When I ask you to "AUDIT:", check the current changes (git diff) against `docs/02_project_rules.md` and `docs/00_architecture.md`.
1. **Check:** Are there any hardcoded magic numbers?
2. **Check:** Is the DDD layer separation maintained? (e.g., Logic layer should not depend on UI)
3. **Check:** Are variable names consistent?
4. **Verdict:**
   - ✅ PASS: "No violations found. Ready to commit."
   - ❌ FAIL: List specific violations and suggest fixes.
